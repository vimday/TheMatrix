# TheMatrix
TheMatrix is a decentralized, cross-chain multiplayer blockchain game inspired by the virtual world of the OASIS from Ready Player One and the Matrix trilogy.
## Overview
TheMatrix is built to be blockchain agnostic and can be deployed on multiple layer 1 and layer 2 networks like Ethereum, StarkNet, Aptos, and Sui.
Players enter TheMatrix, a virtual open world powered by blockchain technology. Inside this virtual realm, players can socialize, compete in games and challenges, collect rare digital assets, and build their own spaces and games.
TheMatrix operates without any central authority. The rules of the world, ownership of assets, and governance of the platform are controlled by the players through decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) and smart contracts.
## Current State
TheMatrix is currently in early development. We have built a basic framework for:
- Cross-chain asset management using bridges
- Multiplayer networking and messaging
- Digital wallet integration
- Modular game plugins and assets
## Roadmap
Our goal is to launch an open alpha of TheMatrix by Q3 2023 with the following features:
- Ability to create customizable avatars
- Public spaces for players to explore
- Mini games and quests with rewards
- Virtual economy with player-owned assets and trading
- Basic creation tools
We welcome contributions from anyone interested in helping us build the foundation for an open, decentralized virtual world. Over time, we aim to transition governance and development of TheMatrix to the community.
